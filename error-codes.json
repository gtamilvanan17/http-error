Sending a large request body to a server after a request has been rejected for inappropriate headers would be inefficient. To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and receive a 100 Continue status code in response before sending the body. The response 417 Expectation Failed indicates the request should not be continued."

The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was 'Moved Temporarily'), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303."

For example, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request."
